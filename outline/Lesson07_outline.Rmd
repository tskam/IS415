title: "Lesson 7: Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation"
description: |
  Localised Geospatial Statistics are a collection of spatial statistical analysis methods for analysing the location related tendency (clusters or outliers) in the attributes of geographically referenced data (points or areas).

These spatial statistics are well suited for:

- detecting clusters or outliers;
- identifying hot spot or cold spot areas; 
- assessing the assumptions of stationarity; and
- identifying distances beyond which no discernible association obtains.
