## Limitation of Statistical Map: Maps lie!

Although both choropleth maps were created using the same variable (i.e. aged population) but the choropleth maps produced look very different.  This is because the choropleth maps were created using two different data classification methods.  For the choropleth map on the left, quantile classification method was used and for choropleth on the right, equal interval classification method was used.   

```{r echo=FALSE}
packages = c('sf', 'tmap', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}

mpszpop2020 <- read_rds("data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds")

```


.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.height=4}
tm_shape(mpszpop2020)+
  tm_fill("AGED",
          n = 6,
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.height=4}
tm_shape(mpszpop2020)+
  tm_fill("AGED",

          style = "equal",
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

- How to identify planning subzones with extreme high or low numbers of aged population?

## Visualising Extreme Values 

.pull-left[
.large[
- **Boxplot** is one one the popular Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) technique used to show the statistics and distribution of data values.]

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=4}

ggplot(data=mpszpop2020, 
       aes(x = "", 
           y = AGED)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
]
--
.pull-right[
.large[The code chunk is:]
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.retina=3}

ggplot(data=mpszpop2020, 
       aes(x = "", 
           y = AGED)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

.large[
Despite its usefulness, boxplot is not able to reveal the spatial distribution of these outliers.
]]

---
## Extreme Value Maps

.vlarge[
- Extreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. 

- These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).
]

---
## Box map

.large[
- Displaying summary statistics on a choropleth map by using the basic priciples of boxplot.

- In essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast, when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the minimum value).

- To create a box map, a custom breaks specification will be used. However, there is a complication. The break points for the box map vary depending on whether lower or upper outliers are present.

## Why Writing Functions?

.vlarge[
Writing a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:

- You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.
- As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.
- You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

### Creating the boxbreaks function

.pull-left[
```{r}
boxbreaks <- function(v,mult=1.5) {
  qv <- unname(quantile(v))
  iqr <- qv[4] - qv[2]
  upfence <- qv[4] + mult * iqr
  lofence <- qv[2] - mult * iqr
  # initialize break points vector
  bb <- vector(mode="numeric",length=7)
  # logic for lower and upper fences
  if (lofence < qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers
    bb[1] <- lofence
    bb[2] <- floor(qv[1])
  } else {
    bb[2] <- lofence
    bb[1] <- qv[1]
  }
  if (upfence > qv[5]) { # no upper outliers
    bb[7] <- upfence
    bb[6] <- ceiling(qv[5])
  } else {
    bb[6] <- upfence
    bb[7] <- qv[5]
  }
  bb[3:5] <- qv[2:4]
  return(bb)
}
```
]

The code chunk on the left is an R function that creating break points for a box map.
- arguments:
    - v: vector with observations
    - mult: multiplier for IQR (default 1.5)
- returns:
    - bb: vector with 7 break points compute quartile and fences

### Creating the get.var function

.pull-left[
```{r}

  v <- df[vname] %>% st_set_geometry(NULL)
  v <- unname(v[,1])
  return(v)
}
```
]

The code chunk on the left is an R function to extract a variable as a vector out of an sf data frame.
- arguments:
    - vname: variable name (as character, in quotes)
    - df: name of sf data frame

### The box map of AGED population

.pull-left[
```{r fig.retina=4, fig.height=5}
boxmap("ECONOMY ACTIVE", mpszpop2020a)
```
]

.pull-right[
- The box map reveals that there are six upper outliers (i.e. planning subzone with extremely high numbers of aged population)

- Four of the upper outliers are located at the eastern region and they are closed to each others.

- There is no lower outlier.

## Choropleth Map for Rates

.pull-left[
.large[
In much of our readings we have now seen the importance to map rates rather than counts of things, and that is for the simple reason that population is not equally distributed in space. That means that if we do not account for how many people are somewhere, we end up mapping population size rather than our topic of interest.

### Raw rate map

.pull-left[
- First, compute the raw rate by using the code chunk below:

```{r}
mpszpop2020a <- mpszpop2020 %>%
  mutate(`AGED%` = (`AGED`
/`TOTAL`)*100) %>%
  filter(`AGED%` >= 0)
```

Next, the boxmap function will be used to plot the raw rate map as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.retina=4, fig.height=5}
var <- get.var("AGED%", mpszpop2020a)
boxbreaks(var)
boxmap("AGED%",mpszpop2020a)
```

]

--
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.retina=4, fig.height=5}
var <- get.var("AGED%", mpszpop2020a)
boxbreaks(var)
boxmap("AGED%",mpszpop2020a)
```
]

### Comparing Absolute and Rate Choropleth Maps

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=4, fig.height=5}
boxmap("AGED",mpszpop2020a)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=4, fig.height=5}
boxmap("AGED%",mpszpop2020a)
```
