What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\r\nGeospatial analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\r\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on\r\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\r\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and process using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\r\nConducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and machine learning methods and\r\nbuilding web-based geospatial analytics applications.\r\nCourse Objectives\r\nUpon completion of the course, students will be able to:\r\nProvide accurate explanation of the mathematical and input data requirements of the analysis method(s) used,\r\nImport, extract, process, transform and assemble geospatial analytical sandbox programmatically,\r\nApply appropriate geospatial analysis methods in addressing specific analysis needs,\r\nCommunicate the analysis results effectively and in an easy to understand manner with the help of appropriate geo- and data visualisation techniques, and\r\nDesign and implement web-based geospatial analytics applications.\r\nCompetencies\r\nDefining Geospatial Analytics and describing the applications of geospatial analytics by using real-world examples.\r\nExplaining the differences between Geospatial Analytics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).\r\nImporting, wrangling and transforming aspatial data by using tidyverse family of packages\r\nImporting, wrangling and transforming geographical data by sing sf package.\r\nGeocoding and georeferencing geographical data programmatically.\r\nPerforming geoprocessing operations programmatically by using sf packages.\r\nPerforming Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using ggplot2 and Confirmatory Data Analysis using ggstatsplot.\r\nPreparing cartographic quality analytical maps by using tmap package.\r\nVisualising and analysing multivariate geospatial data using corrplot and heatmaply packages.\r\nExplaining the principles and methods of spatial point patterns and complete spatial randomness.\r\nPerforming spatial point pattern analysis by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the principles and methods of spatial weights.\r\nComputing spatial weights by using appropriate functions of spdep package.\r\nExplaining the concepts of spatial autocorrelation, spatial clusters, hot spot and cold spot areas.\r\nComputing localised geospatial statistics by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the principles of explanatory modelling and methods of geographically weighted regression.\r\nCalibrating geographically weighted regression models by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the concept of geographic segmentation and methods of spatially constrained clustering.\r\nPerforming spatially constrained cluster analysis by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the concept of spatial dependency and methods of spatial interpolation.\r\nPerforming spatial interpolation by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nDefining geographic accessibility and explaining the methods of accessibility analysis.\r\nPerforming geographic accessibility analysis by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nDesigning geospatial application programmatically by using free and open source software and packages (i.e. R, R packages and Shinny).\r\nPrerequisites/Co-requisites\r\nNIL. (But a basic working knowledge of computer and numeracy will be assumed. Students are expected to understand Windows-based operating systems and to manage files and disk space responsibly. More importantly, students taking this course must be willing to learn R programming.)\r\nCourse Assessments\r\nAssessment Categories Weightage (%)\r\nClass Participation and In-class Exercise 25%\r\nTake-Home Exercise (15% x 3) 45%\r\nGeospatial Analytics Project 30%\r\nCourse Assessment Details\r\nClass Participation\r\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\r\nTake-home Exercise\r\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\r\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\r\nGeospatial Analytics Project\r\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\r\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\r\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report.\r\nOther Important Information\r\nAcademic Integrity:\r\nAll acts of academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, facilitation of acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of exam questions, or tampering with the academic work of other students) are serious offences. All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of assessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of the policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. When in doubt, students should consult the instructors of the course. Details on the SMU Code of Academic Integrity may be accessed at http://www.smuscd.org/resources.html\r\nAccessibility and Accommodations:\r\nSMU strives to make learning experiences accessible for all. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers due to disability, please let the instructor know immediately. You are also welcome to contact the university’s disability support team if you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations:included@smu.edu.sg\r\nPlease be aware that the accessible tables in our seminar room should remain available for students who require them. Emergency Preparedness for Teaching and Learning (EPTL): As part of emergency preparedness, Instructors may conduct lessons online via the WebEx platform during the term, to prepare students for online learning. During an actual emergency, students will be notified to access the WebEx platform for their online lessons. The class schedule will mirror the current face-to-face class timetable unless otherwise stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
