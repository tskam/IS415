You will also learn how to collecting, processing and analysing spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\r\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the first week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor before the end of Week 8. A project proposal in the form website edited using either blogdown or distill for RMarkdown on Netfily will be prepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by the end of Week 8.\r\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project, problems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.\r\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the details including the final application, user guide, poster, practice research paper by the end of week 14.\r\nProject Theme\r\nStudents are required to choose one of the following theme to develop the GeoSpaital Analytics Project:\r\nSpatial Point Patterns Analysis\r\nGeographical Accessibility and Spatial Interaction Models\r\nFlow and Movement Data Analytics\r\nGeographically Weighted Regression Models\r\nAnalytical Regionalisation and Geographical Segmentation\r\nExploratory Spatial Data Analysis\r\nPlease feel free to approach me for more details.\r\nProject Milestone\r\nBrainstorming project ideas and consulting with course instructor between Week 2 to Week 7.\r\nEditing and publishing project proposal by the end of Week 8.\r\nSubmission of final application, user guide, project poster, practice research paper and artifacts: 19th November 2021 by 11:59pm (mid-night)\r\nProject Deliverables\r\nProject Website\r\nProject Github\r\nAt the beginning of the project, project teams are required to create a project Github. The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\r\nProject Website\r\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using either blogdown or distill for RMarkdown. It will be disseminated by using webserver such as Netfity.\r\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\r\nThe title of your project,\r\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\r\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at eLearn).\r\nPoster\r\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\r\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\r\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\r\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\r\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\r\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\r\nThe project poster must be prepared by using posterdown. The final output format of the poster must be in pdf format.\r\nNote: The poster will be considered a final deliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design and data visualisation principles and best practice to your poster.\r\nGeospatial Analytics Application Practice Research Paper\r\nThe research paper should be in the form of Geospatial Analytics Application practice and research. In particular it should contain the followings:\r\nMotivation of the application\r\nReview and critic on past works\r\nDesign framework - A detail description of the design principles used and data visualisation elements built (Refer to Section IV: Interface of this paper.\r\nDemonstration - Use case\r\nDiscussion - What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? A full blown user study is not expected, but informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.\r\nFuture Work - A description of how your system could be extended or refined.\r\nThe research paper should include an abstract of not more than 300 words. The actual research paper itself should not more than 6 pages excluding figures, tables, formula and references. The practice research paper must be edited by using R Markdown and the ACM: Association for Computing Machinery template of rticles should be used.\r\nSample practice research papers\r\nDIVAD: A Dynamic and Interactive Visual Analytical Dashboard for Exploring and Analyzing Transport Data\r\nMEPHAS: an interactive graphical user interface for medical and pharmaceutical statistical analysis with R and Shiny\r\nSpatialEpiApp: A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Disease Data\r\nDeveloping web-based data analysis tools for precision farming using R and Shiny\r\nEHDViz: clinical dashboard development using open-source technologies\r\nHealth Equity Assessment Toolkit\r\nInteractive Pharmacometric Applications Using R and the Shiny Package\r\nFinal Deliverables\r\nThe final deliverable will include:\r\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\r\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\r\nproject poster\r\na practice research paper\r\nGrading\r\nThe geospatial analytics project will account for 30% of your final grade in the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows:\r\nProject website 20%\r\nPoster 10%\r\nPractice Research Paper 25%\r\nShinyApp 45%\r\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\r\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\r\nGrading criteria for poster\r\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\r\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\r\nClear communication of design approaches\r\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\r\nCraft quality of the solution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\r\nGeospatial analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\r\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on\r\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\r\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and process using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\r\nConducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and machine learning methods and\r\nbuilding web-based geospatial analytics applications.\r\nCourse Objectives\r\nUpon completion of the course, students will be able to:\r\nProvide accurate explanation of the mathematical and input data requirements of the analysis method(s) used,\r\nImport, extract, process, transform and assemble geospatial analytical sandbox programmatically,\r\nApply appropriate geospatial analysis methods in addressing specific analysis needs,\r\nCommunicate the analysis results effectively and in an easy to understand manner with the help of appropriate geo- and data visualisation techniques, and\r\nDesign and implement web-based geospatial analytics applications.\r\nCompetencies\r\nDefining Geospatial Analytics and describing the applications of geospatial analytics by using real-world examples.\r\nExplaining the differences between Geospatial Analytics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).\r\nImporting, wrangling and transforming aspatial data by using tidyverse family of packages\r\nImporting, wrangling and transforming geographical data by sing sf package.\r\nGeocoding and georeferencing geographical data programmatically.\r\nPerforming geoprocessing operations programmatically by using sf packages.\r\nPerforming Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using ggplot2 and Confirmatory Data Analysis using ggstatsplot.\r\nPreparing cartographic quality analytical maps by using tmap package.\r\nVisualising and analysing multivariate geospatial data using corrplot and heatmaply packages.\r\nExplaining the principles and methods of spatial point patterns and complete spatial randomness.\r\nPerforming spatial point pattern analysis by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the principles and methods of spatial weights.\r\nComputing spatial weights by using appropriate functions of spdep package.\r\nExplaining the concepts of spatial autocorrelation, spatial clusters, hot spot and cold spot areas.\r\nComputing localised geospatial statistics by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the principles of explanatory modelling and methods of geographically weighted regression.\r\nCalibrating geographically weighted regression models by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the concept of geographic segmentation and methods of spatially constrained clustering.\r\nPerforming spatially constrained cluster analysis by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nExplaining the concept of spatial dependency and methods of spatial interpolation.\r\nPerforming spatial interpolation by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nDefining geographic accessibility and explaining the methods of accessibility analysis.\r\nPerforming geographic accessibility analysis by using appropriate R package(s) and providing accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\r\nDesigning geospatial application programmatically by using free and open source software and packages (i.e. R, R packages and Shinny).\r\nPrerequisites/Co-requisites\r\nNIL. (But a basic working knowledge of computer and numeracy will be assumed. Students are expected to understand Windows-based operating systems and to manage files and disk space responsibly. More importantly, students taking this course must be willing to learn R programming.)\r\nCourse Assessments\r\nAssessment Categories Weightage (%)\r\nClass Participation and In-class Exercise 25%\r\nTake-Home Exercise (15% x 3) 45%\r\nGeospatial Analytics Project 30%\r\nCourse Assessment Details\r\nClass Participation\r\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\r\nTake-home Exercise\r\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\r\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\r\nGeospatial Analytics Project\r\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\r\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\r\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate.\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Indonesia on March 2, 2020. It started with two cases in March. As of July 31 2021, there had been 3,409,658 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia and 94,119 reported cumulative deaths. All cases were spread in 34 provinces in Indonesia. Among all the provinces, DKI Jakarta (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta and in English: Special Capital Region of Jakarta) contributed close to 24% of the cumulative confirmed cases.\r\nDespite its compactness, the cumulative confirmed cases were not evenly distributed within DKI Jakarta as Figure below reveals at the district and sub-district levels. The question was where were the sub-districts with relatively higher number of confirmed cases and how they changed over time.\r\nObjectives\r\nThe take-home exercise aims to embark you the skill of perform geospatial analysis to “Think Globally, Act Locally”. You will also acquire the skills of documenting the analysis procedures conform to reproducible best practice using RMarkdown. Last but not least, you will also learn the skill of communicating your work via web post.\r\nThe specific objective of the exercise is to reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of monthly cumulative confirmed COVID-19 rate and death rate at sub-district or kelurahan.\r\nThe Task\r\nIn this take-home exercise, you are tasked to reveal the spatia-temporal patterns of COVID-19 case at DKI Jakarta. The temporal interval must be at month (last day of the month) and the geographic should be at sub-district or kelurahan in Indonesia language. The specific tasks are as follow:\r\nData Extraction, Wrangling and Integration\r\nApstial data\r\nDownload the daily COVID-19 data of DKI Jakarta,\r\nExtract ID_KEL, Nama_provinsi, nama_kota, nama_kecamatan nama_kelurahan, POSITIF (cumulative confirmed cases) and meninggal (cumulative death cases) from data worksheet of the daily COVID-19 data, and\r\nIntegrate the daily data into a data frame by month.\r\nGeospatial data\r\nDownload DKI Jarkata shapefile,\r\nImport the shapefile into R and save it in a simple feature data frame format, (Note: The national Projected Coordinates Systems of Indonesia is DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1)\r\nExclude all the outer islands from the DKI Jakarta sf data frame, and\r\nRetain the first nine fields in the DKI Jakarta sf data frame. The ninth field JUMLAH_PEN = Total Population.\r\nGeospatial data integration\r\nCombine the geospatial and aspatial data frame into simple feature data frame.\r\nCalculate the cumulative confirmed cases rate (i.e. cases per 10000 population) and the cumulative death rate by month.\r\nThematic Mapping\r\nPlot maps to show the spatio-temporal distribution of cumulative confirmed cases rate and death rate at sub-direct level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.\r\nAnalytical Mapping\r\nPlot analytical maps to show the spatio-temporal distribution of cumulative confirmed cases rate and death rate at sub-direct level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.\r\nThe Data\r\nFor the purpose of this assignment, the following data should be used:\r\nOpen Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta. This portal provides daily update of COVID-19 measures at both sub-district and district level. For the purpose of this exercise, data at the sub-district level will be used. This data is available in data worksheet.\r\nIndonesia Geospatial. This portal provides a comprehensive collection of geospatial data mainly in ESRI shapefile format at different geographical levels. For the purpose of this study, the Shapefile (SHP) Batas Desa Provinsi DKI Jakarta provided at PODES 2019 geospatial layer should be used.\r\nGrading Criteria\r\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\r\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need. (Warning: All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\r\nGeospatial Analysis (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate thematic and analytics mapping techniques and R functions introduced in class to analysis the geospatial data prepared. You will be assessed on your ability to derive analytical maps by using appropriate rate mapping techniques.\r\nGeovisualisation (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the complex spatial statistics results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\r\nReproducibility (20 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of RMarkdown. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\r\nBonus (10 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data. The methods used must be geospatial in nature.\r\nSubmission Instructions\r\nThe write-up of the take-home exercise must be in distill or blogdown format. You are required to publish the write-up on Netlify.\r\nThe R project of the take-home exercise must be pushed onto your Github repository.\r\nYou are required to provide the links to Netlify service of the take-home exercise write-up and github repository on eLearn.\r\nDue Date\r\n10th September 2021 (Friday), 11.59pm (midnight).\r\nReference\r\nHealth Ministry of Indonesia.

The data are cumulative. Hence, to download the data by month, you only need to download every last day of the month. In this case, there are only 19 files to download (assuming that 31 January 2020 - 31 July 2021). I have downloaded the data manual to try out myself and it won’t take more than 15minutes to download all of them. In fact, for your information, I have downloaded all the daily data until yesterday. This is the job of a data analyst 😞\r\n\r\nQ2:\r\nIn addition, when you mention “Integrate the daily data into a data frame by month” Do you mean we have to download multiple sheets and combine the data? If so does this mean we need to download for the last 30 days? or multiple months?\r\n\r\nProf Kam: Refer to earlier reply above.\r\n\r\n(I am unsure if this is the case or whether you refer to a specific feature. Unfortunately i do not understand the data at all given that most of the features are in a foreign language)\r\n\r\nProf. Kam: Yes, you have to download multiple workbooks and extract the worksheet and columns you need and then combine them into an integrated data file. This is what we called data wrangling in Data Science. You will learn how to do it using readxl, tydyr and dplyr package. With regard the foreign language, less worry because translation will be provided. In will be included in the revised version of the Take-home Exercise 1 handout latest by tomorrow morning 9.00am.\r\n\r\nQ3:\r\nLastly, when you mention “Download the DKI Jarkata shapefile” Is this manual downloading or do we need to dynamically download by code and extract and import from there?\r\n\r\nProf. Kam: Personally, I think download manually is easier because I just need to click on the link provided. After downloading, you are required to use sf package of r to parse the data into R and save it as a simple feature data frame. You will learn more on how to work with R package in next week lesson.\r\n\r\nQ4:\r\nIn this case, there are only 19 files to download (assuming that 31 January 2020 - 31 July 2021). On the webpage of daily updates (https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/), I am only able to see the data file starting from 25 March 2020 onwards. In addition, the link to access the data file for 31 January 2021 is broken.\r\n\r\nProf Kam: Since the data only starts on 25 March 2020, then there is nothing wrong the first month data is on 31st March 2020. Likewise if 31st January 2021 is not available, there is nothing wrong 30th January 2021 data set is used. More important, you are required to document these two issues on your report.\r\n\r\nQ5:\r\nSome of the excel files had duplicate columns with the same name. For the Meninggal column, can I confirm that we look at the column without N/A values?\r\n\r\nProf Kam: We are interested in analysing the geographical distribution of Cumulative Death. In this case, the Meninggal without NA values should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
