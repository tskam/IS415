## What is geographically referenced attribute?

.large[
A kind of data that is very similar to an ordinary data.  The only difference is that each observation is associated with some form of geography such as numbers of aged population by planning zone.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
packages = c('ggstatsplot', 'DT', 'sf', 'tmap', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

```{r tx-wrangle, highlight.output = 9:13}
geodemog <- readRDS("data/geodemog.RDS")
glimpse(geodemog)
```

## Describing attribute distribution

The dependency ratio values by planning subzone are normally distributed.

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
gghistostats(data = geodemog, 
             x = DEPENDENCY,
             xlab = "Dependency ratio",
             centrality.parameter = "median",
             normal.curve = TRUE,
             normal.curve.args = list(color = "red", size = 1)
  )

```

## Geographical distribution question

.large[
Are the planning subzones with high proportion of dependency ratio randomly distributed over space?]

.center[

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=15, fig.height=6}

tm_shape(geodemog)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "Dependency ratio") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 
```

## Spatial Dependency

.pull-left[
.large[
- Spatial dependence is the spatial relationship of variable values (for themes defined over space, such as rainfall) or locations (for themes defined as objects, such as cities). 

- Spatial dependence is measured as the existence of statistical dependence in a collection of random variables, each of which is associated with a different geographical location.

## Spatial Autocorrelation

.large[
- Spatial autocorrelation is the term used to describe the presence of systematic spatial variation in a variable. 

- The variable can assume values either: 
    - at any point on a continuous surface (such as land use type or annual precipitation levels in a region); 
    - at a set of fixed sites located within a region (such as prices at a set of retail outlets); or 
    - across a set of areas that subdivide a region (such as the count or proportion of households with two or more cars in a set of Census tracts that divide an urban region).]

## Positive Spatial Autocorrelation

.pull-left[
.large[
- Clustering
    - like values tend to be in similar locations.

- Neighbours are similar
    - more alike than they would be under spatial randomness.
    
- Compatible with diffusion
    - but not necessary caused by diffusion.
]]

## Negative Spatial Autocorrelation

.pull-left[
.large[
- Checkerboard patterns
    - “opposite” of clustering

- Neighbours are dissimilar
    - more dissimilar than they would be under spatial randomness

- Compatible to competition
    - but not necessary competition

## Row standardisation

.large[
- Row-standardised weights increase the influence of links from observations with few neighbours, which binary weights vary the influence of observations.
    - Those with many neighbours are up-weighted compared to those with few.]

## Spatially Lagged Variables

.large[
With a neighbor structure defined by the non-zero elements of the spatial weights matrix W, a **spatially lagged variable** is a weighted sum or a weighted average of the neighboring values for that variable. In most commonly used notation, the spatial lag of y is then expressed as Wy.

Formally, for observation i, the spatial lag of yi, referred to as [Wy]i (the variable Wy observed for location i) is:] 

.center[
![:scale 40%](img/image6-17.jpg)]

.large[where the weights wij consist of the elements of the i-th row of the matrix W, matched up with the corresponding elements of the vector y.
